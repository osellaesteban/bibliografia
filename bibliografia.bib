  Abstract                 = {A new method for fault tolerant control is presented. The fault is considered as switching in the system dynamics and a switching based approach is thus adopted for the fault tolerant control of the system. This approach can be used to model multiplicative faults, such as actuator and sensor faults, as well as component faults. It is applied to passive fault tolerant control where the fault is never detected, and to active fault tolerant control where the fault is detected and isolated within a given time limit. The fault may not be known accurately and some uncertainty in the fault can be considered as an uncertainty in the systems dynamics after the fault has occurred. A controller that stabilizes the system, and achieves guaranteed performance is obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities. An illustrative example of aircraft control is given.},

Considering a general description of a nonlinear sampled-data system, we establish a prescriptive framework for multirate observer design via an approximate discrete-time model of the plant. This framework is shown to be input-to-state stable in a semiglobal practical sense with respect to the estimation error for the unknown exact discrete-time model. A numerical example of an aerospace vehicle with input and output channels of various sampling rates demonstrates how the multirate observer can drastically improve performance compared with the single-rate observer.},

  Abstract                 = {For discrete-time linear time invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly, the state feedback control law which minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive for a wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider the problem of stabilizing linear parameter varying (LPV) systems by means of gain scheduling control. This technique amounts to designing a controller which is able to update its parameters on-line according to the variations of the plant parameters. We first consider the state feedback case and show a design procedure based on the construction of a Lyapunov function for discrete-time LPV systems in which the parameter variations are affine and occur in the state matrix only. This procedure produces a nonlinear static controller. We show that, different from the robust stabilization case, we can always derive a linear controller, that is, nonlinear controllers cannot outperform linear ones for the gain scheduling problem. Then we show that this procedure has a dual version which leads to the construction of a linear gain scheduling observer. The two procedures may be combined to derive an observer-based linear gain scheduling compensator.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents a feedback scheduling mechanism in the context of co-design of the scheduler and the control tasks. We are particularly interested in controllers where the execution time may change abruptly between different modes, such as in hybrid controllers. The proposed solution attempts to keep the CPU utilization at a high level, avoid overload, and distribute the computing resources evenly among the tasks. The feedback scheduler is implemented as a periodic or sporadic task that assigns sampling periods to the controllers based on execution-time measurements. The controllers may also communicate feedforward mode-change information to the scheduler. As an example, we consider hybrid control of a set of double-tank processes. The system is evaluated, from both scheduling and control performance perspectives, by co-simulation of controllers, scheduler and tanks},

We propose a method to design a switched control which allows to place the poles of each subsystem in desired locations and which guarantee that the switched system is asymptotically stable using Lyapunov arguments. In case of output feedback, we prove a separation principle for this class of hybrid systems. Hence, the design of the switched state feedback control and the switched observer can be carried out independently. The results are formulated in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities conditions.},

This framework, which addresses both abrupt and incipient faults, utilizes a nonlinear adaptive detection observer along with a parameter estimator for failure assessment. The sensor failure is modeled either as an additive perturbation or as a multiplicative perturbation of the sensor signal that has magnitude described by a time varying function. Robust adaptive schemes are introduced to account for modeling errors that affect the diagnosis process and may cause false alarms. Further extensions from standard adaptive control techniques are applied to guarantee convergence of certain signals to residual sets. Numerical studies for mechanical systems are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed automated diagnostic scheme},

It outlines the principles and most important techniques of model-based residual generation using parameter identification and state estimation methods with emphasis upon the latest attempts to achieve robustness with respect to modelling errors. A solution to the fundamental problem of robust fault detection, providing the maximum achievable robustness by decoupling the effects of faults from each other and from the effects of modelling errors, is given. This approach not only completes the theory but is also of great importance for practical applications. For the case where the prerequisites for complete decoupling are not given, two approximate solutions--one in the time domain and one in the frequency domain--are presented, and the crossconnections to earlier approaches are evidenced.

The scheme consists of three modules: a bank of estimators, each one associated with healthy and faulty model configurations, a logic mechanism for identifying healthy-to-faulty and faulty-to-healthy transitions and an estimate based control reconfiguration unit. The idea is to abstractly describe healthy and faulty plant configurations by means of a switching paradigm and sequences of pre-computed inner approximations of one-step controllable sets. Such regions are then on-line exploited together with a switching logic to determine the current plant configuration on the basis of the state estimate provided by the observers.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel ultimate bound and invariant set computation method for continuous-time switched linear systems with disturbances and arbitrary switching. The proposed method relies on the existence of a transformation that takes all matrices of the switched linear system into a convenient form satisfying certain properties. The method provides ultimate bounds and invariant sets in the form of polyhedral and/or mixed ellipsoidal/polyhedral sets, is completely systematic once the aforementioned transformation is obtained, and provides a new sufficient condition for practical stability. We show that the transformation required by our method can easily be found in the well-known case where the subsystem matrices generate a solvable Lie algebra, and we provide an algorithm to seek such transformation in the general case. An example comparing the bounds obtained by the proposed method with those obtained from a common quadratic Lyapunov function computed via linear matrix inequalities shows a clear advantage of the proposed method in some cases.},

A distributed approach offers many potential benefits, such as reduced development time and cost, simplified system installation, increased flexibility for system expansion or modifications, and greater reuse of proven components. The distributed approach can also reduce the risk associated with design errors by splitting complex hardware and software into more manageable components. However, distributed systems also introduce new challenges in meeting real-time deadlines and providing fault tolerance. This paper examines the many design considerations and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each. Emerging automotive drive-by-wire alternatives are compared for application to aerospace systems. This paper is based on a Draper Laboratory-sponsored effort to look at flight-critical distributed systems and to evaluate emerging hardware and software for building them.},

In an MPC, the control signal is obtained by on-line optimization of a cost function, and the MPC task may experience very large variations in execution time from sample to sample. Unique to this application, the cost function offers an explicit, on-line quality-of-service measure for the task. Based on this insight, a feedback scheduling strategy for multiple MPCs is proposed, where the scheduler allocates CPU time to the tasks according to the current values of the cost functions. Since the MPC algorithm is iterative, the feedback scheduler may also abort a task prematurely to avoid excessive input-output latency. A case study is presented, where the new approach is compared to conventional fixed-priority and earliest-deadline-first scheduling. General problems related to the real-time implementation of MPCs are also discussed.},

Parametric expression of controller is given based on feasible solution of linear matrix inequality (LMI). The plant IAE index is adopted to assign priority, therefore more control performance is considered while scheduling.

  Abstract                 = {A kind of networked control system is studied; the networked control system with noise disturbance is modeled based on information scheduling and control co-design. Augmented state matrix analysis method is introduced, and robust fault-tolerant control problem of networked control systems with noise disturbance under actuator failures is studied. The parametric expression of the controller under actuator failures is given. Furthermore, the result is analyzed by simulation tests, which not only satisfies the networked control systems stability, but also decreases the data information number in network channel and makes full use of the network resources.},

  Abstract                 = {The supervision of technical processes is the subject of increased development because of the increasing demands on reliability and safety. The use of process computers and microcomputers permits the application of methods which result in an earlier detection of process faults than is possible by conventional limit and trend checks. With the aid of process models, estimation and decision methods it is possible to also monitor nonmeasurable variables like process states, process parameters and characteristic quantities. This contribution presents a brief summary of some basic fault detection methods. This is followed by a description of suitable parameter estimation methods for continuous-time models. Then two examples are considered, the fault detection of an electrical driven centrifugal pump by parameter monitoring and the leak detection for pipelines t~y a special correlation method.}

First two types of observers are designed. One is a discrete-time semiglobal and practical reduced-order observer for the exact model and the other is a continuous-time semiglobal and practical full-order observer for continuous-time strict feedback systems with sampled observation. Then by combining the designed continuous-time observers and continuous-time state feedback laws that are continuous, zero at the origin, and uniformly globally asymptotically stabilise continuous-time systems, output feedback semiglobally practically uniformly asymptotically stabilising controllers are constructed. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed design of observers and output feedback controllers.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the development of an integrated control design approach for regulation, trajectory tracking, diagnosis and control reconfiguration of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Athree-layer controller architecture is proposed to enhance the autonomy of the vehicle. At the bottom layer, the local feedback controllers are designed using H1/H2 control design technique to drive the actuators directly. A four-degree-of-freedom controller is used to incorporate the sensor and actuator faults and to account for the interaction between the regulation and the diagnostic module. A predictive control design technique is employed at the middle layer (guidance) to manoeuvre optimally the AUV along a desired trajectory. A robust filtering scheme is proposed at the top level to provide the necessary information to the guidance system and to reconfigure the system under fault conditions. The condition for global stability is derived and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique.},

This paper also complements Shumway and Stoffer's (1991) dynamic linear models with switching, by introducing dependence in the switching process, and by allowing switching in both measurement and transition equations. Building upon ideas in Hamilton (1989), Cosslett and Lee (1985), and Harrison and Stevens (1976), a basic filtering and smoothing algorithm is presented. The algorithm and the maximum likelihood estimation procedure is applied in estimating Lam's (1990) generalized Hamilton model with a general autoregressive component. The estimation results show that the approximation employed in this paper performs an excellent job, with a considerable advantage in computation time.A state-space representation is a very flexible form, and the approach taken in this paper therefore allows a broad class of models to be estimated that could not be handled before. In addition, the algorithm for calculating smoothed inferences on the unobserved states is a vastly more efficient one than that in the literature.},

We show that if we design a continuous-time controller for a continuous-time plant so that the closed-loop continuous-time system is input-to-state stable and then discretize the controller and implement it using sample and zero order hold devices, then input-to-state stability property will be preserved for the sampled-data multi-rate closed loop system in a practical sense. },

First, we employ the multirate sampling method together with the augmented state matrix method to model the long random delay networked control systems as Markovian jump systems. Then, a H{$\inf$} fault detection filter is designed based on the model developed. Through the appropriate choice of the filter gain, the filter is convergent if there is no disturbance in the system, meanwhile the effect of disturbances on the residual will satisfy a prescribed H{$\inf$} performance. The problem of achieving satisfactory sensitivity of the residual to fault is formulated and its solution is given. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.},

The proposed strategy selects, at each instant of time, the sensor (belonging to a collection of sensors) that provides the best closed loop performance, as measured by a control-performance criterion. It is assumed that each sensor has an associated feedback controller that has been designed such that the sensor-controller pair stabilises the closed loop system under normal operation conditions. Stability of the switching system under normal (fault-free) operation conditions is established in the main result of this paper. In addition, a simulation example illustrates that the proposed switching system is able to maintain performance levels close to the desirable ones, and to preserve stability, even under the occurrence of severe faults in some of the sensors.},

A command generator tracker/proportional-plus-integral/Kalman filter (CGT/PI/KF) form of controller was chosen for each of the elemental controllers within the MMAC algorithm and each was designed via LQG synthesis to provide desirable vehicle behavior for a particular failure status of sensors and actuators. The MMAC performance is enhanced by an alternate computation of the MMAC hypothesis probabilities, use of maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) versus Bayesian form of the MAC (or a modified combination of both), and reduction of identification ambiguities through scalar residual monitoring for the case of sensor failures},

First, the fault-detection and isolation (FDI) scheme that employs model-based techniques for the isolation of faults is reviewed. The FDI scheme provides detection and isolation of any fault that enters into the differential equation of only synchronously measured states, and grouping of faults that enter into the differential equation of any asynchronously measured state. For a fully coupled process system, fault-detection occurs shortly after a fault takes place, and fault isolation, limited by the arrival of asynchronous measurements, occurs when asynchronous measurements become available. Fault-tolerant control methods with a supervisory control component are then employed to achieve stability in the presence of actuator failures using control system reconfiguration. Numerical simulations of the polyethylene reactor are performed, demonstrating the applicability and performance of the proposed fault-detection and isolation and fault-tolerant control method in the presence of asynchronous measurements.},

Multiple models are used to describe the different environments and the control is effected by switching to an appropriate controller followed by tuning or adaptation. The study of linear systems provides the theoretical foundation for the approach and is described first. The manner in which such concepts can be extended to the control of nonlinear systems using neural networks is considered next. Towards the end of the article, the applications of the above methodology to practical robotic manipulator control is described},

When the family of controllers is locally bounded, uniformly in the sampling period, the inter-sample behavior can also be uniformly bounded so that the (time-varying) sampled-data model of the plant is uniformly semi-globally practically stabilized. The result justifies controller design for sampled-data nonlinear systems based on the approximate discrete-time model of the system when sampling is sufficiently fast and the conditions we propose are satisfied. Our analysis is applicable to a wide range of time-discretization schemes and general plant models.},

For reducing the network load and thus minimizing the uncertainty caused by transmission delay or packet dropout, instead of transmitting all measurements of velocity sensors at each sampling time, only one velocity sensor can have access to the network to transmit its measurement. In order to increase accuracy and rapidity of fault detection in motor of Drone, an approach based on Multi Sequential Probability Ratio Test for residual classification and fault detection of each motor is proposed. Then in function of accepted hypothesis of each sequential test a new communication sequence is chosen from ensemble of admissible communication sequences which preserves more medium access to a sub-system (motor) with more deviation from its normal condition.},

Although the requirement for an individual automobile may be more relaxed, similar requirements apply for automobiles in general (Rushby, 2001), because of their large number as compared to aircraft. Consumer-grade electronics have failure rates that are orders of magnitude worse than this. Hence, redundancy to improve failure rates and fault tolerance to prevent faults from propagating both are essential elements of a safety critical networked control system (NCS). TTP/C is a member of the time-triggered protocol (TTP) family that satisfies Society of Automotive Engineers Class C requirements for hard real-time fault-tolerant communication. A model is presented for a fault-tolerant NCS using TTP/C communication. Appropriate features of TTP/C are incorporated in the model. A simulation is presented for the electric power steering node with switching controller, which makes the node tolerant to the parameter faults column.},

It includes three sources of uncertainties, namely uncertainties in the plant model, uncertainties in networked communications and uncertainties in possible actuator failure/malfunction. Other main features are: (i) the fault statistics of each actuator is individually quantified, and (ii) a united framework is proposed to have logic zero-order-holders embedded in the NCS. The latter enables actuators - when in normal operation - to use the latest actuating signals available to them. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, three theorems are proved in the study for the system stability and controller design. Theorem 1 gives a matrix inequality for the system asymptotical stability in the mean-square and is the foundation of the other two theorems. Theorem 2 shows a stability condition regarding the design of a robust state-feedback control for the system under study. Finally, Theorem 3 gives a modified stability condition that can be employed for actual design. A numerical example is presented to show how such a robust controller can be designed.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of state feedback sampled-data stabilization of nonlinear systems is considered under the “low measurement rate” constraint and in the presence of (not necessarily small) time delay in the measurement channel. A multirate control scheme is proposed that utilizes a numerical integration scheme to approximately predict the current state from the delayed measurements. For both the controller emulation approach and the approach based on approximate discrete-time model of the system, we show that under standard assumptions the closed-loop multirate sampled data system is asymptotically stable in the semiglobal practical sense. An illustrative example of sampled-data control of vertical take off and landing aircraft is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the tracking control of nonlinear networked control systems (NCS) affected by disturbances. We consider a general scenario in which the network is used to ensure the communication between the controller, the plant and the reference system generating the desired trajectory to be tracked. The communication constraints induce non-vanishing errors (in general) on the feedforward term and the output of the reference system, which affect the convergence of the tracking error. As a consequence, available results on the stabilization of equilibrium points for NCS are not applicable. Therefore, we develop an appropriate hybrid model and we give sufficient conditions on the closed-loop system, the communication protocol and an explicit bound on the maximum allowable transmission interval guaranteeing that the tracking error converges to the origin up to some errors due to both the external disturbances and the aforementioned non-vanishing network-induced errors. The results cover a large class of the so-called uniformly globally asymptotically stable protocols which include the well-known round-robin and try-once-discard protocols. We also introduce a new dynamic protocol suitable for tracking control. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to derive new results for the observer design problem for NCS. It has to be emphasized that the approach is also new for the particular case of sampled-data systems.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, the fault detection problem for the networked flight control systems with packet dropout is investigated. The networked flight control systems with periodic packet dropouts are treated as a varying sampling rate system. Refer to the non-periodic packet dropout that could be described as a Markov process, the varying sampling rate networked control system could be farther modeled as a discrete-time Markov jump linear system. Based on this model, considering a more general situation that the transition probabilities are partially known, a fault detection filter is established whose robust performance index is optimal. Meanwhile the corresponding fault detection problem can be transformed to an LMI optimization problem, and sufficient conditions to solve this problem are simultaneity derived. Finally, a networked flight control system is considered to validate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method.},

Based on this optimal fusion criterion, a general multi-sensor optimal information fusion decentralized Kalman filter with a two-layer fusion structure is given for discrete time linear stochastic control systems with multiple sensors and correlated noises. The first fusion layer has a netted parallel structure to determine the cross covariance between every pair of faultless sensors at each time step. The second fusion layer is the fusion center that determines the optimal fusion matrix weights and obtains the optimal fusion filter. Comparing it with the centralized filter, the result shows that the computational burden is reduced, and the precision of the fusion filter is lower than that of the centralized filter when all sensors are faultless, but the fusion filter has fault tolerance and robustness properties when some sensors are faulty. Further, the precision of the fusion filter is higher than that of each local filter. Applying it to a radar tracking system with three sensors demonstrates its effectiveness.},

In periodic communication sequence-based NCS, at each time instant only parts of the actuators and sensors are allowed to communicate with the central FD system, which leads to incomplete plant information at the central station. In this article, a parity space based multi-solution FD scheme is proposed based on different information structures of the incomplete plant information. In this multi-solution scheme, each solution is an independent residual generator and has different properties. It is proved that there is a tradeoff between fast FD and detection performance, i.e. the solution with a smaller FD delay has a poorer fault sensitivity and thus a larger miss detection rate, whereas the one with a higher fault sensitivity has a larger FD delay. The FD scheme can be realised by diagnostic observers as well, which have more design freedom. Simulation results are also given to illustrate the results obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {This study deals with the problem of designing an integrated fault-tolerant control (FTC) methodology for non-linear dynamical networked control systems subject to time-varying delay. For the convenience of residual generation, influence caused by network-induced delay is transformed into time-varying uncertainty, which facilitates further manipulation. A fault diagnosis scheme is utilised for fault detection and isolation. On the basis of the uncertainty and fault information obtained by the fault diagnosis procedure, an FTC component is developed to compensate for the effects of uncertainty and fault. In the absence of fault, a nominal controller is employed to deal with the system uncertainty. After fault detection estimator is activated, the controller is reconfigured to guarantee the boundedness of all the system signals until the fault is isolated. After the fault is isolated, the controller is reconfigured to improve the control performance by using the fault information generated by the isolation module. In addition, the stability of the proposed scheme is rigorously investigated. Finally, a simulation example is utilised to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.},

The stability and performance of the closed loop system are then not only determined by the characteristics of the control system, but also determined by the scheduling manner imposed by network. A simple information scheduling scheme is presented and the admissibility problem of such information scheduling approach is also studied through the stability justification of the closed loop system for given sampling manner. A numerical example illustrates the proposed method.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent research has shown that event-driven control requires less samples than time-driven (periodic) control. Consequently, event-driven control applied to Networked Control Systems (NCS) is a good approach for alleviating controllers bandwidth demands and reducing overall network traffic. Following this trend, this paper presents an execution rule for event-driven networked controllers that at each job execution aims at postponing the next job execution while applying an appropriated controller gain considering each varying sampling interval that applies at run time. This method permits to dynamically lower the generated traffic for each networked control loop while ensuring the same or better control performance than the achieved by the periodic case. In addition, an implementation strategy capable of dealing with network induced time delays is also presented. Simulation results illustrate the operation and benefits of the presented approach.},

It is assumed that the full state of the system is not measured and, instead, a measured output corrupted with measurement noise is available. It is also assumed that the control inputs are subject to polyhedral constraints. The CE control implementation uses a receding-horizon control law to compute the control action based on a state estimate obtained from a moving horizon state estimator. The structure of the solution is given by a piece-wise affine function of the parameters of the problem and a partition of the parameter space into polyhedral regions. Inside each of these polyhedral regions a given affine function is used to compute the current CE control input to be applied to the plant. The parameterized regions and coefficients of the piece-wise affine function can be pre-computed offline, allowing a simplified approach in implementing the output-feedback controller online.},
